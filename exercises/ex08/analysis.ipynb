In the markdown cell below, brainstorm 3 to 5 ideas you think would create value for you.\n",

    "2. Adding more data analysis type projects from the beginning of the year will help increase interest in the class for students interested in Machine learning etc (aka typically Stat majors).\n",
    "3. The course should require people to have completed more math prerequisits, because students with more experience in math typically fare better in Comp 110.\n",
    "4. Visiting tutoring should be made mandatory by the course, because it would increase non-Comp major student interest for CompSci.\n",
    "5. The course should make attending any one Hackathon mandatory because it would increase the likelihood of students to learn more coding languages/increase interest in Comp related professional fields."

    "I expected a clear correlation between notetaking and having a better understanding. And my data does seem to agree ~62% of the time, which although visually and numerically seems noteworthy, isn't actually statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that doesn't automatically refute the hypothesis, more like inclining towards inconclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the analysis stronger, it would be better to get a larger pool of data and also define \"understanding\" in a more concrete manner, maybe using grades instead of human feelings: one student's definition of \"understanding\" could be radically different from that of another student.\n",
    "\n",
    "And even if we consider this data to be significant enough to support my hypothesis, there's the factor of confounding variables. Maybe it's not note taking that causes understanding, but rather students that understand the class are more likely to take notes because they find class interesting: there isn't necessarily a causation effect here, just correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So before we go on to add more homework (that may or may not be effective) for students, it's important to eliminate confounding  variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no potential costs to the course, only that stakeholders (the students) will have more work, which increases the chances of them disliking the class."
